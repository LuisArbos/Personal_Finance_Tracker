# Personal Finance Tracker

### Currently work in progress. ###

This is a learning project I've been planning on doing. I'll try to use it for my finances. I've developed an easy to use GUI using customtkinter library. This program is meant to cover at least the four basic following functions:
* Add income
* Add expense
* Show a history of movements
* Show a small graphic of all the movements

## Final version ##

I could say I'm done with this project right now. It works as I expected it to work. I've been using this to practice my knowledge on pandas library, a bit of GUI development and also a bit of data representation. This version has more things than the previous one:
* There is an option to switch between English and Spanish.
* Once you try to add an income or expense, you have to add also a category, and even leave a comment if you feel like it.
* I've added a basic filter section, where you can select the type of income or expense you want to visualise. Both the graph and the historic list changes based on this filter.
* There is a button to upload the data from a csv file, or to keep the data into a csv file.
